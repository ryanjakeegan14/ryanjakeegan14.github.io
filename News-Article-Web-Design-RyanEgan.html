<center/><h2>Strengthening The Community</h2>
<p>Saint Vincent DePaul Mission of Waterbury, located in Waterbury Connecticut, provides much needed resources for those living in poverty in the area. They provide things such as a thrift store, a soup kitchen, a food pantry, and a Homeless Shelter. The resources that they are able to provide are possible because of the generosity of the community.</p>

<br></br>

<center/><h2>Providing</h2>
<p>In Saint Vincent DePaul’s last fiscal year, they were able to provide shelter for 613 people, they provided 59,433 cooked meals, 49,155 bagged groceries, they provided 1,116 people with clothing, and 75 different families with furniture. They are already able to provide so much, imagine how much more they could do with more support.</p>

<br></br>

<center/><h2>Understanding the Impact</h2>
<p>When somebody is down and struggling, sometimes all they need is a little help, St Vincent Depaul’s does exactly that. They are able to change people’s lives for the better and get them back on their feet. If it wasn’t for the work they do, many people would continue to have to go through there struggles alone.</p>

<br></br>

<head><b>The best way to understand the Impact something has on a community, is to hear it from the community themselves.</b></head>

<p></p><q>I have been going to the soup kitchen since I was nine years old. They have helped me so much with anything that I needed, like food, toiletries, and supplies. I am now 18 and I like to volunteer there and see how they help others. It's not all about food and go. We are like a family giving and helping one another.</q> -- Maxwell Ortiz</p>
